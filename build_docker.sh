# WARNING: Tailscale is not yet officially supported in Docker,
# Kubernetes, etc.
#
# It might work, but we don't regularly test it, and it's not as polished as
# our currently supported platforms. This is provided for people who know
# how Tailscale works and what they're doing.
#
# Our tracking bug for officially support container use cases is:
#    https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale/issues/504
